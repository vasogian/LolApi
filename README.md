# LolApi
I have developed an API, which communicates with Riot Game's API and gets information about a player's profile. It consists of 9 endpoints, which include all CRUD actions 
and it is also connected to a database, which saves all player names that have been searched as well as the number of times those names have been searched. I have used the 
following technology and programming concepts:
 1. MVC  
 2. Dependency Injection
 3. Repository Pattern 
 4. Polly 
 5. Entity Framework Core
